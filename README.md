# TechnologyForwardGovernment
A workspace for ideas encouraging a "Technology Forward" style of government, actively implementing and encouraging adoption of technology driven solutions.

# Catalyst
The catalyst for a lot of this thought was further research into the very technologically enlightened governance of Estonia, while researching their ['e-resident' program](https://e-estonia.com/) 

They have managed to promote widespread adoption of cryptographic signatures, issued to their citizens via identify cards.  These can then be used to access services, and even to sign documents in a legally recognised manor.  This was increasingly desirable follow a recent house move that seemed to require the frequent exchange of hand signed documents, via an expensive and antiquated postal service.

The widespread adoption of a uniquely assigned and cryptographically secure signing process opens up opportunities for the secure, encrypted, verifiable and fast transfer of documents between one or more parties.  Obviously there are already tools like GnuPGP which enable these processes, and make use of long understood cryptographic processes.  But complexity of operation, and the lack of widespread adoption are arguably significant barriers to entry, especially in the fields of government and business.  Estonia appears to have been very successful in driving this adoption, and in doing so has opened up all manor of opportunities for innovation.

There are many immediately obvious uses for document signing etc. which with sufficient encouragement could enable significantly faster and more efficient business transactions, especially when applied to international business.

One of the key areas of interest here, is the encouragement of thought, discussion and debate, regarding the application of technology to governance, business and social problems.


# Future Development

## Encouragement for the widespread adoption of open source
Open source has done very well in some areas of innovation, especially in computer software.  Here it is often used to harness the power of a group of likeminded people, to develop an alternative to existing commercial offerings, or to enable the development of something not commercially viable.

In the context of Government though, Open source provides some other key advantages.  Commercial companies are financially encouraged to develop solutions to problems widely experienced, therefore providing themselves with the largest pool of potential purchasers.  In the case of a government they are likely to have unique software demands, not experienced in industry.  As such it seems that governments have frequently taken a custom development approach, or made do with unsuitable tools.  

Here, Open source collaboration can ‘crowd source’ innovations in this are.  If governments worldwide can be encouraged to contribute good quality software, open to internationalisation, huge efficiency gains could be realised.  This is likely to be immediately relevant to the developed world, but could also be used to provide guidance and solutions for developing nations.  Encouraging properly administered and structured democracy, and laying pathways for technological adoption. 

## Applications for block chain technologies
The application of block chain technology, and its ability to provide a public, cryptographically sign proof of ownership, and transaction history for an asset, seems well suited to public record keeping.  Sweden is currently experimenting with the use of a block chain for use documenting ownership of assets in the land registry.  This fits particularly well with an Estonian style identity card and signature as a means to unequivocally assert ownership of an asset, via a multi-party signed block chain ledger.

## Online voting and greater involvement of the public in decision making
Estonia again leads the way here, having already implemented solutions to enable the secure public participation in governance online.  In the UK we are currently approaching a referendum on our participation in the EU.  Currently a referendum is a major event, requiring significant administration, staffing and expense, and as such is a very rare event.  With widespread adoption of technologies such as that used in Estonia, we could potentially open up many more decisions to the public, enabling much more direct democracy, and helping reduce the gap the public commonly feel between them and a countries governance processes.
